Git was originally authored by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing 
to its initial development.[12] Since 2005, Junio Hamano has been the core maintainer. As with most other distributed version control 
systems, and unlike most clientâ€“server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history 
and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server.[13] Git is free and open-source software 
distributed under the GPL-2.0-only license.

Git development began in April 2005, after many developers of the Linux kernel gave up access to BitKeeper, a proprietary source-control 
management (SCM) system that they had been using to maintain the project since 2002.[14][15] The copyright holder of BitKeeper, Larry McVoy,
 had withdrawn free use of the product after claiming that Andrew Tridgell had created SourcePuller by reverse engineering the BitKeeper 
protocols.[16] The same incident also spurred the creation of another version-control system, Mercurial.

Linus Torvalds wanted a distributed system that he could use like BitKeeper, but none of the available free systems met his needs. Torvalds 
cited an example of a source-control management system needing 30 seconds to apply a patch and update all associated metadata, and noted 
that this would not scale to the needs of Linux kernel development, where synchronizing with fellow maintainers could require 250 such 
actions at once. For his design criterion, he specified that patching should take no more than three seconds, and added three more goals.
